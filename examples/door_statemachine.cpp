// ================= 0. (Optional) For convenience include fsm.hpp and do a 'using' on namespace ====================

// 0.1
// fsm.hpp includes all other headers mentioned below
#include <chestnut/fsm/fsm.hpp>
// 0.2
// Writing this long two-part namespace every time can be annoying :) 
using namespace chestnut::fsm; 





// ====================================== 1. Define your statemachine type ============================================

// 1.1. (Optional)
// Create a state extension class.
// By default a statemachine class has access only to the very basic state methods like canEnterState.
// States will still be able to transition between each other, the statemachine class will simply not be able to interact with them in any more custom manner.
// An extension class will allow you to use more than these basic methods and set up a way to communicate with states.
// Extension can have pure virtual methods for example so that states will actually be forced to implement them.
// By creating a statemachine with state extension you will be able to call public methods of that extension on states
class DoorStateExtension
{
public:
    virtual bool tryOpen() = 0;
    virtual bool tryClose() = 0;
};

// 1.2. 
// To create a custom statemachine class include statemachine.hpp header

#include <chestnut/fsm/statemachine.hpp>

// ...If you decided to use a state extension class, in the template parameter of chestnut::fsm::Statemachine
// input this type. Otherwise you can just write chestnut::fsm::Statemachine<> for a basic setup
class CDoorStatemachine : public Statemachine<DoorStateExtension>
{
public:
    // 1.3. (Optional) 
    // You can make your statemachine able to be used across threads in an async manner
    // The base Statemachine type does not support multithreading, so you'll have to set up the necessary precautions yourself
    mutable std::mutex doorMutex;


    CDoorStatemachine();


    // 1.4. (Optional) If you want you can create methods in the statemachine with the same signatures that you gave in point 1.1
    // This will make them look as a sort of "state-virtual" methods, 
    // i.e. methods which behaviour depends almost solely on the current state of the statemachine

    bool tryOpen()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock( doorMutex );

    bool tryClose()
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock( doorMutex );
        return getCurrentState()->tryClose();
    }
};




// ====================================== 2. Define your states ======================================

// 2.1. Be aware of the order of your includes!
//
// Calls to initState(), gotoState() and pushState() require that the state type given to them in the template parameter is a *complete* type.
// If you need a mutual state dependency (e.g. state A goes to state B and vice versa) it's best to properly divide
// state class body and its methods' definitions.
// You can't make state transition to a forward declared state!
// If you decide to write a statemachine it'd be a lot better to keep each state (and the statemachine itself) in seperate .h and .cpp files 
//
// More on incomplete types: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type#Incomplete_type

// 2.2
// To create a state class first include state.hpp header

#include <chestnut/fsm/state.hpp>

// ...then inherit from chestnut::fsm::State 
// for the template parameter give it the type of the statemachine you created
// The base state type will be deduced from a typedef inside the statemachine class
class CDoorStateClosed : public State<CDoorStatemachine>
{
public:
    // 2.3. (Optional) 
    // States can have a custom constructor or just a default one
    // You pass these custom parameters when you call initState(), gotoState() or pushState()
    CDoorStateClosed( bool printOnNullState = false );

    // 2.4. (Optional) 
    // Override methods that will be called when a statemachine enter or leaves the state
    // The data about the transition (whether it was done with popState() method for example) is in StateTransition struct in the parameter
    // You are not obligated to override these methods however
    void onEnterState( StateTransition transition ) override;
    void onLeaveState( StateTransition transition ) override;
    
    // 2.5. (Optional)

    // If you don't have a state that could be good candidate for a state that the machine should always eventually transition back to
    // you can simply create an empty state! Just inherit from the base state type and that's it. 
    // State does not force you to override any pure virtual methods or create any special constructors.
    //
    // Based on point 3.1 if we wanted to use a state transition method on CDoorStateClosed we have to use it AFTER its complete type body.
