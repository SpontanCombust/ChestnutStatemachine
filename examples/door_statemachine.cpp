// ================= 0. (Optional) For convenience include fsm.hpp and do a 'using' on namespace ====================

// 0.1
// fsm.hpp includes all other headers mentioned below

// 0.2
// Writing this long two-part namespace every time can be annoying :) 
using namespace chestnut::fsm; 






// ====================================== 1. Define your statemachine type ============================================

// 1.1. (Optional)
// Create a state extension class.
// By default a statemachine class has access only to the very basic state methods like canEnterState.
// States will still be able to transition between each other, the statemachine class will simply not be able to interact with them in any more custom manner.
// An extension class will allow you to use more than these basic methods and set up a way to communicate with states.
// Extension can have pure virtual methods for example so that states will actually be forced to implement them.
// By creating a statemachine with state extension you will be able to call public methods of that extension on states
class DoorStateExtension
{
public:
    virtual bool tryOpen() = 0;
    virtual bool tryClose() = 0;
};


// 1.2. (IMPORTANT!)
// A thing or two about cyclic dependency:
// All state change methods like gotoState() or initState() take state type name as the template parameter. This and also the fact that 
// underneath a instance of this class is created means that the type you give to these methods has to be a *complete type*. 
// What this in turn means is that there has to be a declaration of said type before its usage and somewhere in an entire translation unit where it happens
// there has to be a body of this state type. To avoid the issue of cyclic header inclusion you can use forward class declaration as shown above. 
// This is C++ and this is a thing we all have to remember and deal with unfortunatelly. 
// More on incomplete types: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type#Incomplete_type
//
// For this reason, because we will want to use CDoorStateClosed below here to initialize the statemachine we will forward declare its type.
// You will see more examples of such action further below.
class CDoorStateClosed; // forward declaration because of usage in CDoorStatemachine::CDoorStatemachine()


// 1.3. 
// To create a custom statemachine class include statemachine.hpp header

#include <chestnut/fsm/statemachine.hpp>

// ...If you decided to use a state extension class, in the template parameter of chestnut::fsm::Statemachine
// input this type. Otherwise you can just write chestnut::fsm::Statemachine<> for a basic setup
class CDoorStatemachine : public Statemachine<DoorStateExtension>
{
public:
    // 1.4. (Optional) 
    // You can make your statemachine able to be used across threads in an async manner
    // The base Statemachine type does not support multithreading, so you'll have to set up the necessary precautions yourself
    mutable std::mutex doorMutex;


    CDoorStatemachine()
    {
        // 1.5. 
		// A statemachine has to be initialized with some entry state
		// This state will stay on the state stack throughout the lifetime of the statemachine and won't be possible to get poppped
		// If you don't have a state that could be good candidate for a state that the machine should always eventually transition back to
		// you can simply create an empty state! Just inherit from the base state type and that's it. 
		// State does not force you to override any pure virtual methods or create any special constructors.
		//
		// 1.6. (Optional) 
		// We can call state transition method with custom parameters. These parameters will be forwarded to state's constructor. See point 3.3.
		// Calling initState() inside a constructor ensures it will always be initialised with this state
		initState<CDoorStateClosed>( true );
    }


    // 1.7. (Optional) If you want you can create methods in the statemachine with the same signatures that you gave in point 1.1
    // This will make them look as a sort of "state-virtual" methods, 
    // i.e. methods which behaviour depends almost solely on the current state of the statemachine

// 2.1
// To create a state class first include state.hpp header

#include <chestnut/fsm/state.hpp>


class CDoorStateOpening; // forward declaration because of usage in CDoorStateClosed::tryOpen()

// ...then inherit from chestnut::fsm::State

    {
        // 2.3. 
        // Inside a state constructor you shouldn't use the getParent() method, because the pointer to the parent statemachine has not been set up by this point
        // Calling it here will throw BadParentAccessException
        // If you want to use the parent statemchine do it in onEnterState and onLeaveState methods instead
        this->printOnNullState = printOnNullState;
    }

    // 2.4. (Optional) 
    // Override methods that will be called when a statemachine enter or leaves the state
