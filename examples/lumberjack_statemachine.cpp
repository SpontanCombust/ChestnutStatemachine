 * @brief A simulation of a game lumberjack game character
 * @details
 * Using the statemachine to simulate a behaviour of a lumberjack in a game revolving about gathering resources.
 * Each lumberjack is launched on a seperate thread. They go around the world harvesting wood from trees.
 * They have a limited wood capacity and have to drop it at the collection point from time to time.
 * Once every tree is harvested they finish their work.
